It directly addresses what someone new to the repository needs: (1) what the tool does/purpose, (2) how it works conceptually, and (3) likely contains setup/usage instructions. The preview shows it starts with a clear project overview explaining the core functionality, which is essential for someone wanting to understand what they're getting into before diving in hands-on. READMEs typically contain installation steps, basic usage examples, and quick-start information - all critical for a 'get your hands dirty fast' guide.",

The table of contents shows it contains essential sections like 'Using the CLI', 'Workflows', 'Creating Templates', and 'Examples' - all critical for someone wanting to get hands-dirty quickly with doc-evergreen. It's a comprehensive how-to guide rather than a learning tutorial, which aligns perfectly with the stated purpose. The fact that it references a Quick Start and README suggests it's positioned as the detailed practical guide for users who want to understand basic usage fast. This is exactly the type of existing documentation that would be invaluable for generating a streamlined 'how do i get started' guide.",
      "key_material": "The CLI usage instructions, workflow patterns, template creation basics, and practical examples will be essential. The core concepts section will help explain what doc-evergreen does briefly. The structure itself (showing what topics are covered) indicates comprehensive coverage of getting-started material. Any troubleshooting common first-time issues would also be valuable for new users getting set up quickly."

For someone brand new wanting to get their hands dirty fast, understanding what templates are and how they work is essential to actually generating documentation. This is practical, actionable knowledge that answers 'how do I use this tool to generate docs?'",

The file provides multiple installation methods (pipx recommended, pip, local install) with concrete commands that can be directly referenced or adapted. It addresses the critical getting-started question: 'How do I install this tool so I can use it?' The content is practical, command-focused, and action-oriented - exactly what someone who wants to 'get their hands dirty fast' needs.",
      "key_material": "Installation commands for pipx (recommended method), pip fallback method, local development installation, and likely system requirements or prerequisites. These are essential first steps that must be documented before any usage instructions.

Someone new to doc-evergreen will need to understand the command-line interface to actually use the tool. The file contains the command structure, available options, and parameters that users will need to invoke. For a 'get hands dirty fast' guide, showing the actual CLI commands is essential - it's the primary way users interact with the tool.",

      "reasoning": "This file is highly relevant for a 'getting started' howto guide. Configuration is typically one of the first things users need to understand when using a documentation tool. The file shows that doc-evergreen uses a `.doc-evergreen.yaml` configuration file, which is essential information for users trying to set up and use the tool. The docstring explicitly mentions 'graceful fallback to defaults' which tells users they may not even need a config file to start. The FileConfig dataclass with a 'template' field indicates customization options users should know about early on.",
      "key_material": "1) The tool uses `.doc-evergreen.yaml` as its configuration file format; 2) Configuration is optional with graceful defaults (important for 'quick start'); 3) File-level configuration exists with template options; 4) YAML format is used for configuration.

It reveals doc-evergreen's architecture approach - that it gathers context from specific hardcoded source files (README.md, amplifier/__init__.py, pyproject.toml, AGENTS.md) to generate documentation. This is useful background for explaining how doc-evergreen works when getting started. However, it's more about internal implementation than direct usage steps. A user needs to understand that doc-evergreen reads certain files, but they don't necessarily need to know the Python implementation details of the context gathering module itself.",
      "key_material": "The SOURCES list showing which files doc-evergreen reads by default (README.md, amplifier/__init__.py, pyproject.toml, AGENTS.md) is useful context. The module docstring explaining it 'collects content from hardcoded source files to provide context for documentation generation' helps explain the tool's approach. The read_source_file function signature hints at how files are processed, though implementation details are less relevant for basic usage."

The TemplateRegistry class is a key component for users who need to understand how to work with templates in doc-evergreen - specifically how to discover, list, and load built-in templates. For someone getting started quickly, knowing that templates can be discovered and loaded programmatically is useful. However, this is more of an advanced/internal API file rather than the primary entry point a new user would interact with. A beginner would more likely use higher-level functions or CLI commands rather than directly instantiating TemplateRegistry. It's useful for understanding the template system architecture but not essential for the most basic 'get started fast' workflow.",
      "key_material": "The class name 'TemplateRegistry' and its purpose of 'discovering and loading built-in templates' from the 'templates/ directory' is useful. The module docstring clearly states it provides methods to 'list and load templates with their metadata', which tells users there's a programmatic way to work with templates. This helps explain one way templates are managed in the system, though the actual method signatures and usage patterns would need to be seen in the full file to provide concrete howto examples."

For someone brand new to doc-evergreen, understanding that it uses Diataxis and differentiates between Tutorial, How-to, Reference, and Explanation documentation types is important context. Since the target document is specifically a 'how-to' guide, knowing that doc-evergreen explicitly supports this as a doc type (and what distinguishes it from tutorials) provides valuable framing. However, this is more of a conceptual/structural file rather than an executable workflow file, so it's useful supporting material but not essential hands-on content.",

For a 'getting started' guide, users will likely need to create or modify templates, so understanding the Section schema (heading, prompt, sources, sections) is directly relevant. However, it's not the entry point - users would typically interact with this through YAML/JSON files rather than this Python code directly. The file shows what fields are available when defining sections, which is practical information for quick usage.",

The test shows the command syntax 'doc-evergreen reverse', its input/output behavior, and provides concrete examples of what the command does (generates templates from existing documentation). For a 'how to get started' guide, showing actual command usage patterns is valuable. However, it's a test file rather than user-facing documentation, so it requires translation into user-friendly format. The file is particularly useful because it shows the reverse workflow - if someone has existing docs and wants to create templates from them.",
