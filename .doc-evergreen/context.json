It is not to give them a deep understanding of how it works internally, instead it is simply output-driven. It answers the question 'how do I use doc-evergreen to get that document output?' because the use of doc-evergreen is for any repo, it should include how to set it up for whatever repo you want to run it for.  a basic quickstart is good.  and more advanced usage should be defferred for another tutorial.  think of this as doc-evergreen 101.",
