# v0.7.0 Deferred Features

**Release**: v0.7.0  
**Date**: 2025-12-06  
**Deferred Count**: 15+ items

---

## 📋 Overview

During the v0.7.0 convergence, we explored two major directions:

1. **"Complete the Workflow"** → Update/maintenance features (change detection, selective regen, automation)
2. **"Generate from Scratch"** → Forward generation from project analysis (generate-doc)

**Decision**: Focus v0.7.0 on Problem #2 (Generate-Doc) because:
- Solves fundamental "no existing docs" problem
- Enables fresh doc creation workflow
- Rethinks document generation approach
- More foundational than incremental improvements
- User expressed clear vision for this approach

This document explains what was explored and deferred for future releases.

## 🎯 Major Deferral: "Complete the Workflow" Features

These were the **original focus** before the pivot to generate-doc. All remain valuable for future releases.

### Theme: Update & Regeneration Intelligence

**DE-v0.7.0-001: Selective Section Regeneration**  
**Priority**: P1 - High  
**Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Labels**: `generation`, `selective-update`, `workflow`

**Description:**
Enable regenerating specific sections instead of entire document. User specifies which sections to update (by name or interactively), system regenerates only those sections while preserving others.

**Use Cases:**
```bash
# Regenerate specific sections
doc-evergreen regen --section "Installation"
doc-evergreen regen --section "Usage,Contributing"

# Interactive selection
doc-evergreen regen --interactive
  → Shows list, user picks sections
```

**Why Deferred:**
- v0.7.0 focuses on fresh doc generation, not incremental updates
- Requires understanding section boundaries and dependencies
- Build on v0.7.0's nesting-aware generation first

**Reconsider When:**
- v0.7.0 is complete and users want granular update control
- Update workflow becomes primary use case
- User feedback requests this specifically

**Priority for v0.8.0**: P1 (High value for maintenance workflow)

---

**DE-v0.7.0-002: Change Detection & Staleness Awareness**  
**Priority**: P1 - High  
**Effort**: 3-4 days  
**Labels**: `automation`, `change-detection`, `workflow`

**Description:**
Intelligent awareness of when documentation needs updates. Track source file changes, detect staleness, notify users when docs are outdated.

**Approaches Explored:**
- **File Hash Tracking:** Track content hashes of sources, detect changes
- **Git Integration:** Use git history to correlate commits to doc sections
- **Timestamp-Based:** Simple "sources newer than output?"
- **Semantic Change Detection:** LLM analyzes if changes are doc-worthy

**Use Cases:**
```bash
# Check staleness
$ doc-evergreen status README.md
  ⚠️  Section "API Reference" may be stale
      - src/api.py modified (used by this section)
  ✓  All other sections up-to-date

# Regenerate only stale sections
$ doc-evergreen regen --stale-only
```

**Why Deferred:**
- v0.7.0 focuses on initial generation, not maintenance
- Requires tracking generation history and source mappings
- Complex feature, deserves dedicated focus
- Build on v0.7.0's source-section mapping

**Reconsider When:**
- Users have docs generated by doc-evergreen and need update workflow
- Maintenance becomes more important than initial generation
- v0.7.0 source mapping is proven

**Priority for v0.8.0**: P1 (Natural next step after v0.7.0)

---

**DE-v0.7.0-003: Stability Tracking for Sections**  
**Priority**: P2 - Medium  
**Effort**: 2 days  
**Labels**: `generation`, `quality`, `tracking`

**Description:**
Track which sections tend to change vs remain stable during regeneration. Use this to identify sections that need different prompts or sources, or to warn users about unstable sections.

**Why Deferred:**
- Requires multiple regeneration cycles to gather data
- More useful after users have established workflows
- v0.7.0 is about first-time generation

**Reconsider When:**
- Users regenerate docs multiple times and notice inconsistency
- Quality issues emerge with specific section types
- v0.8.0 adds regeneration intelligence

**Priority for v0.8.0**: P2

---

### Theme: Automation & Integration

**DE-v0.7.0-004: Git Integration & Change Detection**  
**Priority**: P1 - High  
**Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Labels**: `automation`, `git-integration`, `workflow`

**Description:**
Use git history to detect when sources changed since last doc generation. Correlate git commits to affected doc sections. Integrate with git workflows.

**Use Cases:**
```bash
# Show which sections affected by recent commits
$ doc-evergreen diff --since HEAD~5
  - "API Reference" (src/api.py modified in commit abc123)
  - "CLI Usage" (src/cli.py modified in commit def456)

# Auto-detect stale sections from git
$ doc-evergreen regen --git-aware
```

**Why Deferred:**
- v0.7.0 doesn't require git integration for fresh generation
- More valuable for update/maintenance workflow
- Build on v0.7.0's source-section mapping

**Reconsider When:**
- Users want automatic staleness detection
- Git hooks integration is desired
- v0.8.0 focuses on update workflow

**Priority for v0.8.0**: P1

---

**DE-v0.7.0-005: Watch Mode / Continuous Regeneration**  
**Priority**: P2 - Medium  
**Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Labels**: `automation`, `developer-experience`, `workflow`

**Description:**
Continuously monitor source files and auto-regenerate docs when changes detected. Like a dev server for documentation.

**Use Cases:**
```bash
# Start watch mode
$ doc-evergreen watch README.md
  Watching sources... Ctrl+C to stop
  
  [Later]
  🔔 src/api.py changed
  ♻️  Regenerating "API Reference" section...
  ✅ README.md updated
```

**Why Deferred:**
- v0.7.0 focuses on one-time generation
- Watch mode is convenience feature, not core value
- Requires robust change detection first (DE-v0.7.0-002)

**Reconsider When:**
- Users want live doc updates during development
- Maintenance workflow is established
- Change detection (DE-v0.7.0-002) is implemented

**Priority for v0.8.0**: P2

---

**DE-v0.7.0-006: CI/CD Integration**  
**Priority**: P2 - Medium  
**Effort**: 1-2 days  
**Labels**: `automation`, `ci-cd`, `integration`

**Description:**
Integrate doc-evergreen into CI/CD pipelines. Check for stale docs, auto-regenerate, create PRs, fail builds if docs outdated.

**Use Cases:**
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Check docs
  run: doc-evergreen check --ci
  
- name: Update docs
  run: doc-evergreen regen --auto --stale-only
  
- name: Create PR
  run: doc-evergreen commit-and-pr
```

**Why Deferred:**
- v0.7.0 is about manual generation first
- CI/CD integration requires mature change detection
- Automation comes after manual workflow is proven

**Reconsider When:**
- Users want automated doc updates in CI
- Manual workflow is proven
- Change detection is reliable

**Priority for v0.8.0**: P2

---

**DE-v0.7.0-007: Git Hook Integration**  
**Priority**: P2 - Medium  
**Effort**: 1-2 days  
**Labels**: `automation`, `git-integration`, `workflow`

**Description:**
Install git hooks to check doc staleness pre-commit or auto-regenerate post-merge. Integrates doc maintenance into normal git workflow.

**Use Cases:**
```bash
# Install hooks
$ doc-evergreen install-hooks

# Pre-commit hook warns
$ git commit -m "Update API"
  ⚠️  Docs may be stale: README.md section "API Reference"
  Continue commit? [y/N]

# Post-merge hook auto-regenerates
$ git pull
  [after merge]
  ♻️  Regenerating stale sections...
```

**Why Deferred:**
- Same rationale as DE-v0.7.0-006 (automation after manual workflow proven)
- Requires change detection

**Reconsider When:**
- Users want docs to stay fresh automatically
- Git-centric workflow is desired

**Priority for v0.8.0**: P2

---

### Theme: Quality & Validation

**DE-v0.7.0-008: Automated Quality Validation**  
**Priority**: P2 - Medium  
**Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Labels**: `quality`, `validation`, `llm`

**Description:**
Validate generated content quality automatically. Check factual consistency, completeness, code example validity, link checking, tone consistency.

**Use Cases:**
```bash
$ doc-evergreen validate README.md
  ✓ Structure valid
  ✓ All links working
  ✓ Code examples syntax valid
  ⚠ Section "API" may be incomplete (confidence: 60%)
  ❌ Section "Usage" contradicts source code
```

**Why Deferred:**
- v0.7.0 focuses on generation, not validation
- Quality validation requires baseline to validate against
- Let users use v0.7.0 first, learn what quality issues emerge

**Reconsider When:**
- Users report quality issues with generated docs
- Validation would prevent common problems
- After gathering quality failure patterns

**Priority for v0.8.0**: P2

---

**DE-v0.7.0-009: Regression Detection (Content Comparison)**  
**Priority**: P2 - Medium  
**Effort**: 2 days  
**Labels**: `quality`, `validation`, `workflow`

**Description:**
Compare regenerated content to previous version, highlight what changed beyond source updates. Detect if regeneration made docs worse.

**Use Cases:**
```bash
$ doc-evergreen regen --preview
  Showing changes:
  
  Section "Installation":
    + Added prerequisite: Python 3.8+
    - Removed outdated npm reference
  
  Section "Usage":
    ⚠️  Tone changed (was friendly, now formal)
    ⚠️  Lost example that was in original
  
  Apply changes? [y/N]
```

**Why Deferred:**
- Requires having previous version to compare
- More useful for updates than initial generation
- v0.7.0 is about fresh generation

**Reconsider When:**
- Users regenerate docs and lose good content
- Maintenance workflow needs safety nets
- After v0.7.0 proves generation quality

**Priority for v0.8.0**: P2

## 🚀 Generate-Doc Enhancements (Deferred)

These are enhancements to the generate-doc feature that aren't needed for MVP.

### DE-v0.7.0-010: Bottom-Up Generation Strategy
**Priority**: P3 - Low  
**Effort**: 3-4 days  
**Labels**: `generation`, `enhancement`, `advanced`

**Description:**
Alternative generation strategy: generate deepest sections first, then parents have context from children. More complex than top-down DFS, but might produce better parent sections.

**Why Deferred:**
- Top-down DFS is simpler and sufficient for v0.7.0
- Bottom-up is optimization, not core requirement
- Adds significant complexity
- Prove top-down works first

**Reconsider When:**
- Top-down generation produces poor parent sections
- Parents need context from children to be coherent
- Users request this specifically

**Priority for v0.8.0+**: P3 (Nice-to-have optimization)

---

### DE-v0.7.0-011: Advanced Relevance ML Models
**Priority**: P3 - Low  
**Effort**: 5+ days  
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `ml`, `advanced`

**Description:**
Replace LLM-based relevance analysis with trained ML models. Fine-tune embeddings on doc-source relationships, faster inference, potentially better accuracy.

**Why Deferred:**
- LLM-based analysis is good enough for v0.7.0
- ML model training requires data we don't have yet
- Premature optimization
- Much higher complexity

**Reconsider When:**
- LLM relevance analysis is too slow or expensive
- We have training data from user feedback
- Accuracy needs improvement and LLM isn't cutting it

**Priority for v0.9.0+**: P3 (Research project)

---

### DE-v0.7.0-012: Multi-Document Generation
**Priority**: P2 - Medium  
**Effort**: 3-4 days  
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `feature`, `multi-doc`

**Description:**
Generate multiple related documents in one session (README + CONTRIBUTING + API_REFERENCE, etc.). Coordinate structure across docs, avoid duplication, maintain consistency.

**Why Deferred:**
- v0.7.0 focuses on single document generation
- Multi-doc coordination is complex
- Get single doc working well first
- Users can run multiple times for now

**Reconsider When:**
- Users want coordinated doc suite generation
- Cross-document consistency becomes issue
- Single doc generation is proven

**Priority for v0.8.0+**: P2

---

### DE-v0.7.0-013: Template Learning & Improvement
**Priority**: P3 - Low  
**Effort**: 5+ days  
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `ml`, `advanced`

**Description:**
Learn from user edits to generated outlines. Improve outline generation over time based on what users keep vs change. Personalized outline patterns per project type.

**Why Deferred:**
- Requires user feedback data we don't have yet
- Static generation needs to work first
- Learning system is significant complexity
- Premature optimization

**Reconsider When:**
- We have data from user edits
- Outline quality needs improvement
- Users want personalized patterns

**Priority for v0.9.0+**: P3 (Research project)

---

### DE-v0.7.0-014: Interactive Outline Refinement UI
**Priority**: P2 - Medium  
**Effort**: 4-5 days  
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `ui`, `ux`

**Description:**
Rich interactive UI for refining generated outlines. Drag-and-drop section reordering, inline prompt editing, source suggestions, preview generation.

**Why Deferred:**
- v0.7.0 uses simple JSON editing (good enough)
- UI development is significant effort
- CLI-first approach for MVP
- Can add UI later if needed

**Reconsider When:**
- JSON editing is too clunky for users
- Outline refinement becomes common workflow
- UI would significantly improve experience

**Priority for v0.8.0+**: P2

---

### DE-v0.7.0-015: Project Type Detection & Templates
**Priority**: P2 - Medium  
**Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `feature`, `templates`

**Description:**
Automatically detect project type (Python CLI, JS library, React app, etc.) and use type-specific outline templates. Pre-built patterns for common project types.

**Why Deferred:**
- v0.7.0 uses generic outline generation (works for any project)
- Type-specific templates are optimization
- Need to see what patterns emerge first
- User specifies doc type (tutorial/howto/etc), which is more important

**Reconsider When:**
- Generic outlines don't work well for specific project types
- We've identified common patterns worth templatizing
- Users want specialized templates

**Priority for v0.8.0+**: P2

## 🎯 Why These Deferrals Make Sense

### Focus: Generate-Doc (Forward Generation)

**v0.7.0 solves ONE problem excellently:** "I have NO docs, create them from project analysis"

**Key decisions:**
1. **Update workflow deferred** → Change detection, selective regen, staleness awareness are valuable but orthogonal
2. **Automation deferred** → Manual workflow needs to work and be proven first
3. **Enhancements deferred** → Core generation needs to work before optimizing
4. **Quality/validation deferred** → Learn what quality issues emerge from usage

### Foundation for Future Work

**v0.7.0 enables:**
- v0.8.0: Update/maintenance workflow (change detection, selective regen)
- v0.9.0: Automation & integration (git hooks, CI/CD, watch mode)
- v1.0.0: Advanced features (multi-doc, learning, UI)

**Not deferred because they're bad** → Deferred because v0.7.0 has clear, foundational focus.

## 📊 Deferral Summary

| Priority | Count | Primary Reason |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| P1 | 3 | Update workflow (wait for v0.7.0 foundation) |
| P2 | 9 | Enhancements & automation (manual first) |
| P3 | 3 | Optimizations & research (premature) |
| **Total** | **15** | **v0.7.0 focuses on forward generation** |

---

## ✅ Key Takeaway

**Why These Deferrals Make Sense:**

1. **Focus:** v0.7.0 solves "generate from scratch" problem excellently
2. **Foundation:** Forward generation is foundational; updates build on it
3. **Learning:** Need to see v0.7.0 usage patterns before optimizing
4. **Scope:** 6-7 sprints is already ambitious; these would balloon it
5. **Value:** Core generation delivers immediate value; enhancements are incremental

**Original "Complete Workflow" ideas aren't forgotten** - they're the natural v0.8.0 focus after v0.7.0 proves forward generation.
